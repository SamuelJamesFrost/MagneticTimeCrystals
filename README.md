# MagneticTimeCrystals

## Install and build

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
run with
```
python3 main.py
```

# TODO

* Add a magnetic field that favours either spin up or down
* Add ability to export just graphs where parameters change e.g. Magnetisation vs Temperature - would need to find the number of cycles until it roughly reaches equilibrium, this could be used to find critical temperature etc.
